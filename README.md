# Executive Summary
Cyclistic operates a bike-share program for consumers across Chicago. Launched in 2016, Cyclistic has grown to service a fleet a 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Cyclistic offers a flexible pricing program for riders: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memeberships. Customers who purchase single-rie or full-day passes are categorized as casual riders, and customers with annual memeberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclistic's current marketing strategy has relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments, focusing on the flexible pricing plans to attract consumers. The company's financial analysts have concluded that annual members generate more profit than casual riders. Lily Moreno, director of marketing, is planning to create a marketing campaign that aims to convert existing casual riders into Cyclistic memebrs. Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth and sustainability.

- *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*
